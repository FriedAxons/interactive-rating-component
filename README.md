## Overview

Use the design images as reference as well as the challenge instructions and the style-guide for help getting started. The goal is to look at the images and try to replicate the design as close to the original image as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
